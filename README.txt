Final Project

I spent 20 hours on this project, which was not nearly enough to accomplish what I had initially hoped. I underestimated the difficulty of the project and was only able to get a small fraction of what I wanted done. The scene depicts a fish under water, and the user is able to change the texture between 3 different kinds of fish. The toughest part of the project was getting the fish to move around without looking extremely clunky, and making the body movement look natural. If I had spent a more ample amount of time on the project I would have wished to accomplish much more. For example, I would have more than one fish on the screen, and they would swim around together as a school. Furthermore, I would have added scenery, such as rocks, seaweed, and an underground volcano. 
The controls for the program are as follows:
* Right, left, up and down arrow keys: change the elevation and angle of the vantage point. 
* 0: reset view angle
* x: toggle axes
* +,-: zoom in or out
* r,y,t: change type of fish (texture)
